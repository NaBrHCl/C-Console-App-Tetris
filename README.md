# C-Console-App-Tetris
A terrible copy of tetris made with C# Console App

To download it, go to the right side and click on release, there you can download the repos

To play the game, go to Tetris -> bin -> Debug -> net6.0
Inside net6.0, open Tetris.exe

If you don't need to edit the code and just need to play the game, just cut and paste the net6.0 folder somewhere else
